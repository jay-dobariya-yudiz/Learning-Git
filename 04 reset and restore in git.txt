-Restore a File from the Last Commit:
git restore filename.txt
-This restores filename.txt to its state from the last commit, discarding any local changes.

-Restore a Staged File to the Working Directory:
git restore --staged filename.txt
-This unstages filename.txt, moving it back to the working directory while keeping your changes intact.

-if you commit by mistake and unstages this commit so copy a hash of one uper commit
git reset "Hash key"
- is it also okay if you put only first 4 ch of hash key
